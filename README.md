# Steven's New Visions for Public Schools Performance Task

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Steps to run the project

In the terminal at the root directory (new-visions), run:

### `npm install`

Once the dependencies have been installed locally, run:

### `npm run start`

You should see the following message in your terminal: "express server is running on port 8000"

Next, change directories to "front-end" in your project terminal:

### `cd front-end`

Install the front end dependencies in the project terminal, run:

### `npm install`

Once the dependencies have been installed locally, run:

### `npm run start`

You should now be able to view the project on https://localhost:3000 (if port :3000 is in use, please refer to your terminal)

## Refer to server.js, studentModel.js, studentRouter.js in the root directory for Mongo Atlas DB code
## Please refer to 'App.js' for component rendering and  'App.css' for styling (both located in the front-end directory)
## Helper functions are located in front-end/src/helpers
